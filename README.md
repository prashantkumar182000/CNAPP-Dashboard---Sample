# Dynamic Dashboard

Dynamic Dashboard is a ReactJS-based application that allows users to personalize their dashboard by adding widgets. The application features a responsive design, supports dynamic widget management, and uses Zustand for state management.

## Features

- **Dynamic Widgets:** Add and remove widgets dynamically.
- **Responsive Design:** Works well on all screen sizes.
- **State Management:** Uses Zustand for efficient state management.
- **Material UI:** Leverages Material UI components for a sleek, modern interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-dashboard.git
cd dynamic-dashboard
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

If you're using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Or if you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

To run the application locally:

```bash
npm start
```

Or with Yarn:

```

The app should automatically open in your default web browser. If it doesn't, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
